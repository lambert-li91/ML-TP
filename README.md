See our paper for more details.

All the codes are being sorted out and will be uploaded in the near future.

# Requirements
Python: 3.6.3 Anaconda 64-bit

# About the data
The data is from 'Telecom-Italia-Big-Data-Challenge'. 
The original data source: https://dandelion.eu/datamine/open-big-data/
# How to execute
Every script can be executed indivdually. 

You can also adjust the parameter settings as needed.

As the last week of this dataset contains the data during Christmas and New Year's Eve, we do not predict it as it is a very challenging task to predict such "outliers".
